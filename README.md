# Project Title Quqdratic-Grader 

## What it does

This project provides two core functionalities: it solves quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx +c =0 and converts numeric scores (0-100) into corresponding letter grade based on a predifined grading scale . It also designed to be a practical tool for both mathematical problem-solving and academic assessment.
Firstly, it tackles quadratic equations. Users can input the coefficients 'a', 'b', and 'c' for an equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation (. The project then calculates and presents the real or complex roots of the equation, providing a clear solution to these algebraic problems. Secondly, the project acts as an intelligent grade converter. It takes a numerical score, typically out of 100, and maps it to a corresponding letter grade according to a specific, established scale. This scale is defined as follows: A+ for scores from 85 to 100, A for 75 to 84, B+ for 65 to 74, B for 60 to 64, C+ for 55 to 59, C for 50 to 54, and D for any score from 0 to 49. This feature is invaluable for educators, students, or anyone needing to quickly understand performance levels represented by numerical values.
